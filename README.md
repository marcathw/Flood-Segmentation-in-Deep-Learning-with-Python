# Flood-Segmentation-in-Deep-Learning-with-Python
This project implements a U-Net-based deep learning model to perform semantic segmentation on satellite images for flood detection. It includes preprocessing steps, image quality checks, and evaluation based on segmentation metrics such as IoU and accuracy.
